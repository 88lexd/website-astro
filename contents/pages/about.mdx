My name is Alex Dinh and I am an IT Consultant based in Sydney, NSW Australia.

This is my personal tech blog where I write about various IT topics, automation and on how I have put this site together.

### Experience
My IT career started as a Systems Engineer in 2011. From the early beginning, automation has always been my passion.

Throughout the years, I've grown to love the field of DevOps and I am very greatful to have been exposed to various different technologies and that eventually got myself into being a Solutions Architect.
