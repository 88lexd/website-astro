# Big announcement!
I am very happy to say that I have fully replaced my previous WordPress blog with this new site that is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build)!

This took me a good 2 weeks to complete and I only get to work on this project a few hours a night.

## What's new?
Here are some highlights that I am very proud of:
- No more DB and Wordpress plugins to manage!
- A more secure website thanks to SSG (Static Site Generator)!
- Applying DevOps best practices
  - e.g. versioning, testing and deploying/releasing
- Argo CD + Argo CD Image Updater
- Fully customizable through using TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS etc..

## Stay tuned!
Stay tuned for my upcoming posts, I plan on writing more on how this new blog site is built and how I have automated many things.

As always, I keep everything I do here as open source, so please feel free to check out my new repo here:
