JSON stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_. Many web API's today returns a JSON response when you communicate with the API endpoint.

For those that are not familiar with JSON, it looks something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "firstName": "bob",
        "lastName": "smith",
        "gender": "male"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "jenny",
        "lastName": "lee",
        "gender": "female"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "andy",
        "lastName": "king",
        "gender": "male"
    },
    {
        "firstName": "stella",
        "lastName": "le",
        "gender": "female"
    }
]
```

In short, the square brackets "\[ \]" represents a list and the curly braces "{ }" represents each object in the list.

Example using jq to count the number of males and females.

```
$ cat names.json | jq -r '.[].gender' | sort | uniq -c
      2 female
      2 male
```

## What is jq and why I use it?

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a popular lightweight utility for querying JSON. It is often used in Bash when you "_curl_" against a web API and it returns a JSON response in which you need to query.

I use jq because I don't always want to rely on Python to handle basic queries to a web API. Especially when it is used within a CI/CD pipeline that is running on Linux (bash)

Here is one other example how I use jq to query the Kubernetes cluster API to extract all the pod names.

```
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/pods | jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' | sort
calico-kube-controllers-f7868dd95-xx
calico-node-xx
coredns-7f9c69c78c-xx

## How to Query using jq

In this section, I will demonstrate jq by using the following requirements. I will be querying the _names.json_ file as shown in the introduction.

- Show the first object in the list
- Show first names and genders only
- Show the object where firstName is andy
- Show objects where lastName starts with "le"
- Replace a value in JSON
- Compressing result into a single line

**Show the first object in the list**

A list always begins with index 0, so the following will get the first object in the list.

```
$ cat names.json | jq '.[0]'
{
  "firstName": "bob",
  "lastName": "smith",
  "gender": "male"
}
```

**Show first names and genders only**

Use the jq pipe to filter only the fields we want to return.

```
# Note: When we don't specify the index, it will use all the objects in the list.
$ cat names.json | jq  '.[] | {firstName,gender}'
{
  "firstName": "bob",
  "gender": "male"
}
{
  "firstName": "jenny",
  "gender": "female"
}
{
  "firstName": "andy",
  "gender": "male"
}
{
  "firstName": "stella",
  "gender": "female"
}
```

**Show the object where firstName is andy**

Use the select function to specify the condition to check

```
# Note: When we don't specify the index, it will use all the objects in the list.
$ cat names.json | jq  '.[] | select(.firstName == "andy")'
{
  "firstName": "andy",
  "lastName": "king",
  "gender": "male"
}
```

**Show objects where lastName starts with "le"**

```
# Note: When we don't specify the index, it will use all the objects in the list.
$ cat names.json | jq  '.[] | select(.lastName | startswith("le"))'
{
  "firstName": "jenny",
  "lastName": "lee",
  "gender": "female"
}
{
  "firstName": "stella",
  "lastName": "le",
  "gender": "female"
}
```

**Replace value in JSON**

Changing the lastName from "king" to "wong"

```
# Note: When we don't specify the index, it will use all the objects in the list.
$ cat names.json | jq '.[] | select(.firstName == "andy") | .lastName = "wong"'
{
  "firstName": "andy",
  "lastName": "wong",
  "gender": "male"
}
```

**Compressing result into a single line**

Putting the result into a single line can be very useful, especially when passing the result into another API call via cURL for example.

```
# Note: When we don't specify the index, it will use all the objects in the list.
$ RESULT=$(cat names.json | jq '.[] | select(.firstName == "andy")' -c)
$ echo $RESULT
{"firstName":"andy","lastName":"king","gender":"male"}
```

## Conclusion

jq is very powerful especially when it is used in a CI/CD pipeline.
