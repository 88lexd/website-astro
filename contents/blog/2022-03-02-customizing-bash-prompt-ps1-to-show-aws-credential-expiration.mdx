This post is a continuation from my previous post on "[AWS â€“ How to Assume Role using Python](https://lexdsolutions.com/2021/09/how-to-assume-role-on-aws-and-using-python/)".

## Recap on my previous post

Previously I've written my own Python script to assume role into AWS and the new set of credential is saved to the "~/.aws/credential" file.

Example on how I assume role:

```
$ assume-role --cred-file ~/cred.yml --roles-file ~/roles.yml --profile prodaccount
===================================
AWS Assume Role Script by Alex Dinh
===================================
Choose a role to assume into:
  [0] Exit
> [1] My Admin Role (My-Admin@12345)
  [2] My NonAdmin Role (My-NonAdmin@56789)
Enter MFA token code for [ arn:aws:iam::12345:user/myusername ]: 123456
Assuming role to: arn:aws:iam::12345:role/My-Admin
Successfully assumed role!
Updating /home/alex/.aws/credentials file...
Your new AWS credentials will now work with awscli. e.g.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --profile prodaccount
```

Assume role do not last forever and it has an expiration. To view the expiration, the script has a --expiry option.

Example:

```
$ assume-role --profile prodaccount --expiry
===================================
AWS Assume Role Script by Alex Dinh
===================================
The AWS profile prodaccount has 59 minutes remaining
```

## The problem

Although I can check the AWS profile expiration by manually calling the script, sometimes when I only have a few minutes remaining and I am executing a "terraform apply", it can cause Terraform to hang.

## The solution

Thanks to Bash in allowing me to customize the prompt, now I can include the time remaining to show up directly on my terminal without having to run the script each time.

Example:
<ImageZoom src="/images/bash-prompt-image-1.png" client:load />

## How it works

This works by getting "~/.bashrc" file to source my custom script which you can find on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/blob/main/misc-scripts/python-aws-assume-role/bashrc-ps1.sh).

The script uses a small Python script that reads the ~/.aws/credential file for the credential expiration and then outputs it as a simple string to my $PS1 variable.

Here is what the script contains on my GitHub (I do recommend to use GitHub's version as the source of truth)

```shell
read_aws_credential_file() {
    python3 <<EOL
from datetime import datetime
import os, configparser
credentials_file = f"{os.getenv('HOME')}/.aws/credentials"
config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read(credentials_file)
expiration = config[os.getenv("AWS_PROFILE")]['expiration']
expiration_datetime = datetime.fromtimestamp(float(expiration))
# Time remaining in minutes
time_remaining = int((expiration_datetime - datetime.now()).total_seconds()/60)
print(time_remaining)
EOL
}

role_expiration() {
    if [[ ! -z $AWS_PROFILE ]]; then
        time_remaining=$(read_aws_credential_file)
        if [[ ${time_remaining} > 0 ]]; then
            echo "[${AWS_PROFILE}|${time_remaining}mins]"
        else
            echo "[${AWS_PROFILE}|EXPIRED(unset AWS_PROFILE)]"
        fi
    fi
}

# Prepend AWS profile expiry info into existing bash prompt
export PS1="\e[1;33m\`role_expiration\`\e[m${PS1}"
```

## Conclusion

The beauty of this is that if you "unset" the AWS\_PROFILE variable, the script will not try to call the Python script at all!

I personally have not experienced any performance impact by this script but only made my productivity a lot higher.
