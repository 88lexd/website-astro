Regex is short for **Reg**ular **Ex**pression. It is often used to search for a sequence of characters by specifying a search pattern.

You can find regex available almost everywhere. In this post I will show a few examples in Python, PowerShell, Bash and Ansible.

This type of pattern filtering can be used in all sorts of contexts. Just to name few:

- CSV files
- Log files
- Configuration files
- HTML (when doing web scraping)

## Quick Example

Have you ever need to extract certain data from a text/configuration file?

Here I have a CSV that contains some server names and its IP addresses.

```
ServerName,IP
server01,10.1.10.1
server02,10.1.10.20
server03,10.1.1.1
server04,10.1.1.40
server05,10.2.2.30
server06,10.2.2.1
server07,10.3.1.50
server08,10.3.1.1
server09,10.4.2.1
server10,10.4.2.80
server11,10.5.1.90
server12,10.5.1.199
```

**Requirement**: I need to find all the servers where the _IP must end with '.1'_. Without using regex, the default grep will return the following which is not what I am after:

```
$ cat servers.csv | grep '\.1'
server01,10.1.10.1
server02,10.1.10.20 << wrong
server03,10.1.1.1
server04,10.1.1.40 << wrong
server06,10.2.2.1
server07,10.3.1.50 << wrong
server08,10.3.1.1
server09,10.4.2.1
server11,10.5.1.90 << wrong
server12,10.5.1.199 << wrong
```

With regex, I can easily extract the information I need. Example:

```
$ cat servers.csv | grep -P '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.1$'
server01,10.1.10.1
server03,10.1.1.1
server06,10.2.2.1
server08,10.3.1.1
server09,10.4.2.1

# OR simply
$ cat servers.csv | grep -P '\.1$'
server01,10.1.10.1
server03,10.1.1.1
server06,10.2.2.1
server08,10.3.1.1
server09,10.4.2.1
```

_Note: The \\. escapes the special character. See cheat sheet below._

## Cheat Sheet

At first, regex may seem very confusing but once you understand the syntax, it's very easy to get what you want.

This is a cheat sheet which I often refer to.

<table><tbody><tr><td>.</td><td>&nbsp;Any character except new line</td></tr><tr><td>\d</td><td>Digit (0-9)</td></tr><tr><td>\D</td><td>Not a digit (0-9)</td></tr><tr><td>\w</td><td>Word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)</td></tr><tr><td>\W</td><td>Not a word character</td></tr><tr><td>\s</td><td>White space (space, tab, newline)</td></tr><tr><td>\S</td><td>Not whitespace (space, tab, newline)</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>^</td><td>Beginning of a String</td></tr><tr><td>$</td><td>End of a string</td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>0 or more of the preceding expression</td></tr><tr><td>+</td><td>1&nbsp; or more of the preceding expression</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>[]</td><td>Matches characters in brackets</td></tr><tr><td>[^ ]</td><td>Matches characters NOT in bracket</td></tr><tr><td>|</td><td>Either Or</td></tr><tr><td>( )</td><td>Group</td></tr></tbody></table>

## More Examples using Different Tools

This is one real world example where I had to rely on regex.

The following is a Windows event log entry (event id: 4728) that I will be using as input for the different examples below.

```
An account was successfully logged on.

A member was added to a security-enabled global group.

Subject:

   Security ID:  LEXD\Administrator
   Account Name:  Administrator
   Account Domain:  LEXD
   Logon ID:  0x27a79

Member:

   Security ID:  LEXD\alex
   Account Name:  cn=Alex,CN=Users,DC=lexd,DC=local

Group:

   Security ID:  S-1-5-21-3108364787-189202583-342365621-1108
   Group Name:  Super Admin Group
   Group Domain:  LEXD

Additional Information:

   Privileges:  -

Expiration time:
```

Note: I will be using this same requirement for the different examples.

**Requirement**: I need to know the member that has been added into the group. In this example, I am looking for "LEXD\\alex"

The challenge with this is that "Security ID:" is also being used to display the subject, member and group. So without using pattern filtering, I cannot easily extract this information.

### Regex in PowerShell

In the real world, this data should come straight from Event Logs as we are using PowerShell, but for this example I am just reading the log from a file to keep it simple.

```powershell
# Note: -Raw will ensure it retains as a single string by keeping the line endings in place
$LogEntry = Get-Content .\event.txt -Raw
$MyRegex = 'Member:\s+Security ID:\s+(.+)'
$Name = ($LogEntry | Select-String -Pattern $MyRegex  | ForEach-Object {$_.matches.groups})
Write-Host "The member is: $($Name[1].Value)"


# Output
PS> .\regex.ps1
The member is: LEXD\alex
```

### Regex in Python

Same as the above, to keep it simple I am reading from a text file.

```python
import re

with open('event.txt', 'r') as _f:
    event = _f.read()

regex_pattern = 'Member:\s+Security ID:\s+(.+)'
result = re.findall(regex_pattern, event)
print(f'The member is: {result[0]}')

```

Example Output
```
$ python3 regex.py
The member is: LEXD\alex
```

### Regex in Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool but uses Regex to locate the configuration you wish to change.

In this example, I will rename "LEXD\\alex" text to become "LEXD\\malicious-actor" just to illustrate the power of regex even in complex environments.

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  become: no
  tasks:
  - name: "Replace 'LEXD\\alex' to become 'LEXD\\malicious-actor'"
    replace:
      dest: /tmp/event.txt
      regexp: '(Member:\s+Security ID:\s+)(.+)'
      replace: '\g<1>LEXD\\malicious-actor'

  - shell: cat /tmp/event.txt
    register: output

  - debug:
      var: output.stdout_lines
```

Playbook execution

```
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

## Conclusion

I hope these examples I've given here will encourage you to learn regex.

Is not as hard as it looks, especially when you have online tools to guide you. I've been using [https://regex101.com](https://regex101.com) to assist me with my regex filters all the time. I simply paste in some dummy data and I can quickly and easily test what works and what doesn't work.
