Previously I wrote a blog about how I've replaced my original MicroK8s cluster with a new 2x node cluster that is built using kubeadm. In this new setup, I have a dedicated jumpbox to manage the cluster. You can read more about this on my [previous blog post here.](https://lexdsolutions.com/2022/01/replacing-microk8s-with-kubernetes-cluster-created-by-kubeadm/)

Here is a quick diagram of my current AWS setup for this blog.

## Always-On is a waste of money

As I don't always need to manage the cluster 24/7, it is a waste of money in keeping the jumpbox instance running.

This leaves me with 2 options for each time I need to use the jumpbox.

1. Log onto the AWS console > start on the instance > update the security group with my dynamic public IP.
2. Use a script to automate this process by calling a single command.

Using option 1 is very time consuming and considering that I still need to go back to my terminal to run SSH anyway, I went with the second option to automate this process.

**Note**: Although it is automated, I still need to assume-role into my AWS account using MFA. This is okay, since logging into the AWS console still requires me to use MFA anyway.

To learn more about what assume-role is, check out my blog called "[AWS â€“ How to Assume Role using Python](https://lexdsolutions.com/2021/09/how-to-assume-role-on-aws-and-using-python/)"

## Starting the jumpbox

To start the jumpbox, all I need to do is pass in _\--start_ to my script and off it goes.

Example:

```raw
$ aws-jumpbox --file config.yml --start
===============================
AWS Jumpbox Script by Alex Dinh
===============================
Found the instance using id [i-0a67xxx]

-----------------
Tags on Instance:
-----------------
Name: Jumpbox

------------------------
Instance State: STOPPED
------------------------

Start the instance? (yes/no): yes
Starting the instance...
Instance State: pending
Instance State: running
Instance started successfully! (public IP: 52.63.xx.yy)

Update security group? (yes/no): yes
Updating security group...
Getting current outbound public IP...
  Current External IP: 49.195.xx.yy
Updating security group ingress rules...
Displaying ingress rules for - sg-0db4xxx
  Protocol: tcp | From Port: 22 | To Port: 22 | Source: [{'CidrIp': '49.195.xx.yy/32', 'Description': 'MyDynamicIP'}]
Security group updated successfully!

Update .ssh/config file? (yes/no): yes
Updating .ssh/config file
Config updated!

Script completed!
```

As seen above, it will start the instance and once it is started, it can also do the following:

**Update security group:** This will update the AWS security group to allow SSH from my current public IP address.

**Update .ssh/config:** This will update my local SSH config so I can use VS Code's remote development via SSH keys. Without this, I must update VS Code to use the new public IP of the jumpbox each time (I didn't want to pay for a EIP as there is a charge involved when it is not attached to a running instance).

## Stopping the jumpbox

To stop the jumpbox, all I need to do is pass in _\--stop_ to my script and off it goes.

Example:

```raw
$ aws-jumpbox --file config.yml --stop
===============================
AWS Jumpbox Script by Alex Dinh
===============================
Found the instance using id [i-0a67xxx]

-----------------
Tags on Instance:
-----------------
Name: Jumpbox

------------------------
Instance State: RUNNING
------------------------

Stop the instance? (yes/no): yes
Stopping the instance...
Instance State: stopping
Instance State: stopping
Instance State: stopped
Instance stopped successfully!

Clean security group rule(s)? (yes/no): yes
Cleaning security group rules with description [MyDynamicIP]...
  Removing -- Protocol: tcp | From Port: 22 | To Port: 22 | Source: 49.195.xx.yy/32
Security group cleaning completed!

Script completed!
```

Since it doesn't hurt to clean up the security group, I have the option to remove the rule which I've added previously when I started the instance.

## The script

If you are interested in the script itself, you can find it on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/tree/main/misc-scripts/python-aws-jumpbox).

## What's next

So this script is great, I can save money by only starting up the instance whenever I need to use it. However there may be a time when I forget to turn off the instance!

For this reason, I have also implemented a Lambda function that runs every hour to make sure my jumpbox uptime does not exceed my defined threshold. If it does then SNS will send me an email notification.

My next blog post will be talking about this Lambda function. If you would like to go ahead you can see the source code that is on my [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/tree/main/aws-wordpress/3-app-configuration/lambda-jumpbox-uptime).
