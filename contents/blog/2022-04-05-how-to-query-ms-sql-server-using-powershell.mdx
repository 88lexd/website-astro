Most of my previous blog posts, I often use Linux as the underlying OS, however when it comes to automation, we should always use the right tool for the job.

## Challenge

There are times where I need to query a Microsoft SQL Server and as most SQL Server authentication is set to use "Windows Authentication Mode", therefore I need to be able to use the built-in Kerberos/NTLM authentication which is part of Windows.

## PowerShell to the rescue

Thanks to PowerShell for having tight integration with Windows, I can run PowerShell as the user or the service account that have access to the database server, run a basic script that can query DB and fetch the data I need.

The data returned from the query is a native PowerShell object (array) and we can use PowerShell cmdlets like Select-Object or Where-Object to further filter out what we want.

There was also a time where I also used regex to select the specific data I want. From my experience, trying to use regex in a SQL query wasn't so easy for me. If you haven't used regex before, you should check out my [previous blog post here.](https://lexdsolutions.com/2021/10/why-regex-is-so-powerful-and-you-should-use-it/)

## How to query SQL Server using PowerShell

Here is a snippet of a small DB containing some users

<ImageZoom src="/images/ps-sql-image.png" client:load />

**The function to call**

I like to wrap commonly used code into a function so I can re-use this wherever I need within the script.

```powershell
function ExecuteSqlQuery {
    param([string]$Server, [string]$Database, [string]$SQLQuery)

    $Datatable = New-Object System.Data.DataTable

    $Connection = New-Object System.Data.SQLClient.SQLConnection
    $Connection.ConnectionString = "server='$Server';database='$Database';trusted_connection=true;"
    $Connection.Open()
    $Command = New-Object System.Data.SQLClient.SQLCommand
    $Command.Connection = $Connection
    $Command.CommandText = $SQLQuery
    $Reader = $Command.ExecuteReader()
    $Datatable.Load($Reader)
    $Connection.Close()

    return $Datatable
}
```

**Writing the query and calling the function**

This is a very simply select \* record query. You can write any SQL queries here to suit your purpose.

```powershell
[string]$Query = @("
SELECT *
FROM
Users
")

$result = ExecuteSqlQuery -Server server01.lexd.local -Database LEXD_TEST -SQLQuery $Query
```

**Result returns back as an array object**

```powershell
PS C:\Users\adm_alex> $result.GetType()

IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
-------- -------- ---- --------
True     True     Object[]                                 System.Array



PS C:\Users\adm_alex> $result | Out-Host

Name                 Gender     Suburb               Contact
---- ------ ------ -------
Alex                 Male       Sydney               123456789
Bob                  Male       Melbourne            234567891
Stella               Female     Perth                345678912
Jill                 Female     Sydney               456789123
```

**Using native PowerShell to handle the response**

```powershell
##################################################
# Using Select-Object to only show Name and Suburb
$result | Select-Object Name,Suburb

# Output
Name                 Suburb
---- ------
Alex                 Sydney
Bob                  Melbourne
Stella               Perth
Jill                 Sydney

##########################################
# Using Where-Object to filter out objects
$result | Where-Object {$_.Suburb -like "Syd*"}

# Output
Name                 Gender     Suburb               Contact
---- ------ ------ -------
Alex                 Male       Sydney               123456789
Jill                 Female     Sydney               456789123


#####################################################################
# Using regex to filter a contact number where "456" is in the middle
$regexResult = @()
$MyRegex = '\d{3}(456)\d{3}.+'
$result | ForEach-Object {
  if (($_.Contact | Select-String -Pattern $MyRegex  | ForEach-Object {$_.matches.groups})) {
    $regexResult += $_
  }
}

$regexResult | Out-Host

# Output
Name                 Gender     Suburb               Contact
---- ------ ------ -------
Alex                 Male       Sydney               123456789
```

## Conclusion

PowerShell can come in handy whenever I need to deal with Active Directory or MS SQL Servers. I hope you find this post useful and please feel free to leave a comment or feedback below.
