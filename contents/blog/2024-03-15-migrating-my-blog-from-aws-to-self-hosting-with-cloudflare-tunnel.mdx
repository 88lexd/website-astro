When I first created my blog, I wanted to self-host the infrastructure. However because of my home connection (5G broadband) is sitting behind a CGNAT, this wasn't possible for me.

With CGNAT I do not have a dedicated public IP address to work with, so I ended up hosting my blog on AWS instead.

## Cloudflare Tunnel

This problem all went away when I've discovered [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/products/tunnel/) and its free! All is required from me is to run a daemon inside my network and point it to the web service which I want it to be accessible over the internet.

Besides being able to host my site myself, Cloudflare provides many additional benefits as well such as security, caching etc.

What Cloudflare offer for free is amazing! I've been using Cloudflare to front my blog about 8 months now. Check out my [previous blog](https://lexdsolutions.com/2023/08/how-i-deployed-cloudflare-using-terraform/) post here to learn more.

## Deploying Cloudflare Tunnel using Terraform

As I was already using Terraform to provision Cloudflare to front my blog, all I had to do is create another resource in Terraform to setup the tunnel. For example:

```hcl
resource "random_string" "tunnel_secret" {
  length  = 32
  special = true
}

resource "cloudflare_tunnel" "lexd_solutions" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  name       = "lexd-solutions"
  secret     = base64encode(random_string.tunnel_secret.result)
}

resource "cloudflare_tunnel_config" "lexd_solutions" {
  account_id = var.account_id
  tunnel_id  = cloudflare_tunnel.lexd_solutions.id

  config {
    ingress_rule {
      hostname = var.hostname_fqdn
      path     = "/"
      service  = "http://192.168.0.23"
    }

    ingress_rule {
      service = "http_status:404"
    }
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_record" "lexd_solutions" {
  zone_id = var.zone_id
  name    = var.hostname_dns_record
  value   = "${cloudflare_tunnel.lexd_solutions.id}.cfargotunnel.com"
  type    = "CNAME"
  proxied = true
}
```

_To see the full source code, you can find it at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/tree/main/wordpress/1-infra-configuration/3-cloudflare)._

Once the tunnel is setup, I just had to log into Cloudflare web console, look for the tunnel to get the token and run the _cloudflared_ service like the following:

```
$ docker run -d --restart unless-stopped cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token abc123
```

## Recreating the Kubernetes Infrastructure

The best thing about using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), I was able to quickly spin up some VMs and setup the Kubernetes cluster in just a few clicks.

This however had some caveats. As I haven't need to run my Ansible playbook for a few years, a lot has changed and the previous Kubernetes v1.23 is no longer supported. On top of that, the previous Kubernetes repository URL got deprecated and was changed (see [announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/pkgs-k8s-io-introduction/)), so most of the cluster configuration failed for me on first run.

I've spend a few hours over 2 nights to fix the Ansible playbook and I can now fully deploy Kubernetes v1.29. You can see the updated playbook in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/tree/main/wordpress/2-os-configuration).

## Migrating WordPress and MySQL

Both the Wordpress service and the MySQL DB is running on Kubernetes on AWS. To make things easy for myself, I was using a [local-path provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).

To migrate the service all I had to do was:

1. Standup the Kubernetes Infrastructure on my local network.

3. Deploy [my Helm Chart](https://github.com/88lexd/lexd-solutions/tree/main/wordpress/3-app-configuration/wordpress-helm) containing Wordpress and MySQL service locally (scaled down to 0).

5. Scale down the deployments on the AWS cluster.

7. Tarball the local path directories used by Wordpress and MySQL on AWS.

9. Upload the tarball to S3.

11. Download the tarball from S3.

13. Extract the tarball at the same location on the local Kubernetes cluster
    - Also ensure owner and permissions are retained.

15. Created a dummy file locally to make sure the website serving over the internet is indeed coming from my local cluster. For example:
    ```shell
    echo "HelloWorld" > /opt/local-path-provisioner/pvc-xx_wordpress-local-pvc/wp-content/uploads/test.txt
    ```

17. Scale up deployments on the local Kubernetes cluster.

19. Start Cloudflare Tunnel daemon.

21. Access my blog URL and try fetch the "test.txt".
    - This worked fine!

23. Shutdown AWS instances to save cost.

25. Done

## What's Next?

Since migrating my blog away from AWS, I did lose out on:

1. Reliable Backups

3. Centralised logging to CloudWatch Logs.

5. Resource monitoring, alerting and dashboards (CloudWatch)

**Backups** - I am performing VM backups to an external storage device. However the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) will be much longer compared to running on AWS if I ever experience any hardware issues.

**Logging, monitoring and dashboards** - I plan on setting up Prometheus and Grafana in my cluster to provide similar level of logging and dashboards for my cluster. Once this is completed, I will write another post on how this is done.
